# Self-Driving-Vehicle-Control-Using-Carla
In this project I implement a controller for the CARLA simulator. The goal was to control the vehicle to follow a race track by navigating through preset waypoints (x,y,speed). The vehicle needs to reach these waypoints at certain desired speeds, so both longitudinal and lateral control was required.
